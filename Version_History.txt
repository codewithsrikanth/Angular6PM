Angular JS 1.X:
- It is completly developed based on MVC and MVVM architecture.
- Latest version is 1.8.X
- It is complelty developed by using plain Javascript.
- It is a library not a framework so that integration can be done by using <script>
- We can create single page application by using "Routing" machanisam.
- "Digestive Cycle"  which will detect all the changes and reloads the entire application.
- It is not mobile friendly.
- Features Routing, Form Validations, Depdency Injuction, Animations, DOM manipulations etc.

Angular2:
- It is complete rewrite of Angular JS
- SPA by using Routing machanism
- Developed based on Mobile and Web
- We can write code by using different langauges like ES5, ES6, Dart, Typescript.
- It is a componenet based architecture so that it is very easy to build and reuse the interfaces.
- Performence of Angular application is 5X faster than Angular JS.

Angular3:
- Angular2 is completly a single repository.
- Beacuse of version mismatch with routing Angular team skipped Angular3 version and relesed directly Angular4.

Angular4: 
- It reduces the Build file size upto 60%
- @angular/animations
- It provides faster compilation using JIT compiler
- Email validator
- *ngIf then else

Angular5:
- HTTPClient API was introduces in Angular5 which is used to simplify the HTTP library for Angular applications.(RxJS)
- Number, Currency, Date pipe multiple changes are happens
- Build files sizes.
- Should support with Typescript 2.3 and above versions.
- Route Guards

Angular6:
- New command to update version "ng update" and "ng add'
- Angular meterial library.
- use of RxJS
- Vallidation objects.

Angular7:
- CLI version 7.0.2 and also Angular meterial is updated
- Build files sizes.
- AOT compiler
- Lazy loading features makes application more faster

Angular8:
- Typescript 3.4
- Speed and performence by reducing build file size.
- Modularity improved
- ng version compability is verified.

Angular9 & 10 & 11:
- Default integration of AOT compiler.
- Bundling is happen for the Javascript with less size so the number of HTTP requests are reduced.
- AOT takecare of minification as well.
- Performence and minor changes are happend.

Angular Vs React JS:
- Angular is a framework and React JS is a ui library.
- Angular can be used to perform anything, React JS is a UI library.
- Both support declarative style programming which means will convert HTML into Javascirpt whcih improves performence.
- Angular is not supported for Virtual DOM, but react is having.
- In React JS we use "Redux, Babel, CLI" and in Angular "NgRX, AOT and Angular CLI".
- Both are open source.
- Learing and implementation wize Angular is good.
- Angular can implmented by using different languages but React can written in Javascript now it support typescript.
- Angular is not good for backward compatability, but react is having good understanding.
- In most US based projects "React JS" is used, in other projects we use mostly "Angular".
